Having also recently been thinking about the current state of AI in Sri Lanka and what it could be (or should be) in the future, I found that the summit provided some very useful perspectives. The perspectives were in the context of two themes.</p></blockquote>

While others argue over GPT-2, we had to dig a little deeper into Google BERT. If you are a follower of deep learning research, specially on NLP side, BERT needs no introduction at this point in time. Since its initial release last October, dozens more resources have been added highlighting the significance of this work by Google.</p></blockquote>

I suspect that for AI projects, especially if you count the ones that never start, the failure rate is even higher. What are the reasons for the high failure rate with AI projects?</p></blockquote>

Specifically, convolution based deep neural networks have performed exceedingly well on 2D representation learning tasks, e.g. image analysis. Given this success, it is natural to investigate how to use this concept to capture features in different settings.</p></blockquote>
