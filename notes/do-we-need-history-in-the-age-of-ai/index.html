            <h1>Do we need history in the age of AI?</h1>

            <p><small>July 18, 2025</small></p>

            <p>There&rsquo;s been some talk about education reforms and updates to the school syllabus in Sri Lanka. Regardless of <a href="https://www.newswire.lk/2025/07/17/pm-responds-to-reports-on-history-subject/" target="_blank">how accurate that news is</a>, it has sparked a conversation about the importance of learning subjects like history. I&rsquo;m not an expert in education or history, but as someone who has worked in AI for a while, I have a few thoughts.</p>

            <p>Throughout most of modern history, the average person&rsquo;s contribution to society was often measured by their hard skills, especially physical labor. But with the rise of technology and automation, many of the tasks that relied on manual labor got replaced. That shift brought attention to a different set of skills: soft skills. It was no longer just about how much effort you put in but also about how you lead, collaborate, manage, negotiate and influence others. A fair amount of research has gone into understanding and emphasizing these skills.</p>

            <p>Even though most jobs no longer required sheer labor, we still had to do &ldquo;knowledge work&rdquo; &mdash; problem-solving, analysis, creativity and so on which wasn&rsquo;t easy to automate. But with the rise of AI, that is also changing. AI is quickly gaining the ability to take on many forms of knowledge work and it keeps expanding.</p>

            <p>Most people observing this shift fall into two camps. One group fears that AI will eventually outpace humans and that will be the end of humanity. The other sees it as an opportunity where AI takes care of the routine work and humans focus on more &ldquo;interesting&rdquo; problems.</p>

            <p>Doomsday scenarios aside, even from an optimist&rsquo;s perspective we have to admit that our role as humans is being questioned or is going to be questioned very soon. If machines can be analytical and creative, what are we doing? What makes us uniquely human? We will have to find an answer to this question but let&rsquo;s leave that to the philosophers.</p>

            <p>When I talk to students and fresh grads, one question that often comes up is what they should do, entering this AI-driven world. What skills should they learn to stay relevant? I don&rsquo;t have a simple answer to this. But one thing I say is to be an exceptional human. And the keyword here is <em>human</em>. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s hard skills alone that make us exceptional anymore. When AI can perform many technical tasks far more efficiently, what really sets you apart are your human qualities, your soft skills.</p>

            <p>I don&rsquo;t think that we fully understand what makes someone curious, creative or emotionally intelligent. There are only theories. But it might not be a stretch to say that subjects like history, literature and the arts can help nurture these qualities. We may have given too much priority to technical skills even before AI started replacing white-collar jobs. And now, in the age of AI, that imbalance matters even more.</p>

            <p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong here, strong foundations in science, math and technology are very important. But when it comes to applying those skills, a lot of the heavy lifting will likely be done by AI. Our role will need to shift toward more human-centered thinking, deeper context and sound judgment. What we learn today shapes how we participate in the world tomorrow. Especially a world where AI might be doing a lot of work. And we may need to revisit the foundations and basic assumptions on which our current education system is built. In that conversation, I think subjects like history must play a bigger role, not a small one.</p><br>
