            <h1>A talk on the reliability of AI systems</h1>

            <p><small>June 4, 2025&mdash;Originally published on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/cdathuraliya_aidataanalyticssummit2025-ai2025-dataanalytics-activity-7336008027797450753-4ixt" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a></small></p>

            <p>It&rsquo;s funny sometimes people try to get me excited about the latest trends in AI. I&rsquo;m not proud to say this, but I&rsquo;m no longer excited about AI the way I used to be. Ten years ago, when I founded the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170726151321/https://www.meetup.com/colombo-machine-intelligence/" target="_blank">Colombo Machine Intelligence Meetup</a>, I was very excited. Now I&rsquo;m cautious.</p>

            <p>Does that mean we should stop working on AI? Absolutely not. In fact we need more people from a wide range of backgrounds working in AI. What we don&rsquo;t need is everyone blindly following the hype without taking the time to think critically.</p>

            <p>Broadly, I want to focus my energy in two directions.</p>

            <p>One is improving the reliability of AI systems. This includes things like alignment, faithfulness, grounding and attribution. While these terms technically mean different things, they all fall under the larger goal of making AI systems more trustworthy and transparent. This is a relatively new focus area for us at ConscientAI. We have been exploring and reflecting on these challenges for about two years now.</p>

            <p>The other is making the field of AI more diverse and inclusive. This is not new for us. It&rsquo;s one of the main reasons ConscientAI was founded, especially in a country like Sri Lanka. We have been actively working on research areas such as <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12336" target="_blank">NLP techniques for low-resource languages</a>. There&rsquo;s a lot more to do in this space.</p>

            <p>I&rsquo;ll be sharing a bit more about the first direction this Friday (6th) at the AI & Data Analytics Summit 2025. Hope to see you there!</p>

            <p>PS: The title of my talk at the same event in 2019 was &ldquo;Artificial Intelligence &ndash; Separating the Hype from Reality&rdquo;. Now I wonder, was it even hype?</p>
