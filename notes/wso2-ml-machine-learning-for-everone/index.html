            <h1>WSO2 Machine Learner: Machine Learning for Everyone</h1>

            <p><small>September 17, 2015&mdash;Originally published on WordPress</small></p>

            <p>Machine learning is everywhere. If you do not agree, you just haven&rsquo;t noticed. It&rsquo;s in your smartphone, web browser, smartwatch if you use one, car very soon, and the list goes on making it simply everywhere. Machine learning has become one of the things that decides the future of mankind, one way or another. There was a time when artificial intelligence, the superset of machine learning, was something we read in science fiction. But not anymore.</p>

            <p>Never heard of what I am talking about? Do a simple Google search and you will end up with thousands of definitions, tutorials, articles and maybe some news on recent ML startup acquisitions. Google itself uses machine learning to bring all that to your web browser. So what is WSO2 Machine Learner? Why should you care?</p>

            <p>WSO2 is one of the leading middleware companies in the world with a very unique business model. Let&rsquo;s leave the details aside, I&rsquo;ll just say that they (or we) develop products that are free and open source. We offer a complete stack of middleware products that are used by top enterprises of the world from integration to API management to real-time analytics. WSO2 Machine Learner is the newest addition to the stack to make machine learning closer to everyone. When we say everyone, we mean it. If you feel like trying out the product even before reading the rest of this post, go try it out! If you think you should look at the code and even make some changes to it, fork it on GitHub!</p>

            <p><b>Spaces: Community and tools</b></p>

            <p>Glad you decided to continue. In this post, I would like to take a step back from my developer role and look at our own product from a typical ML user&rsquo;s perspective. You might be a researcher, developer or even a CEO who is interested in trying out machine learning in your next venture. Reading this will give you an idea of why WSO2 Machine Learner can be one of the best choices you make when it comes to machine learning.</p>

            <p>There are different types of users in machine learning. There are researchers who make this field what it is and decide its shape in the future, developers who apply the theoretical work done by the latter in practical problems using dedicated tools and also there are industry practitioners who look at this field as a new opportunity to grow their businesses. CXOs might fall into the last category. Interestingly in machine learning, these entities usually overlap, with highly research-oriented CEOs and scientists developing industry solutions. Most of the top scientists in machine learning (and deep learning recently) are leading the industry towards catering more futuristic products to end users with AI/ML. At the same time, top machine learning startups have been initiated mainly by the best researchers in this field.</p>

            <p>To make all these a reality, we need tools. Tools that let all these entities work more efficiently and effortlessly. If you look at the ML tooling landscape, once again you will see different types of tools. There are products that are very easy to use and intuitive, but most often they are not free. And there are products that are very powerful and extensible, but you will have to get your hands dirty (dig into code and make changes). Most of the tools used by researchers fall into this category. They have their reasons to use them (I had my own). Another set of tools will give you rich dashboards, visualizations with a very user-friendly UI, but not enterprise-ready. If you are looking for all of the above, you may not end up with many choices. We hope that this will change soon. And instead of just hoping, we decided to build one to deliver most of them today and more in the future.</p>

            <p><b>How does WSO2 Machine Learner help?</b></p>

            <figure>
                <img src="wso2_ml_workflow.png" alt="WSO2 Machine Learner workflow">
                <figcaption><small>WSO2 Machine Learner workflow</small></figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>WSO2 Machine Learner is powered by Apache Spark, a popular and powerful large-scale data processing engine. All the machine learning algorithms available in WSO2 ML use the Spark engine at the product&rsquo;s core. With the recent boost from IBM, it's safe to say that Spark is here to stay, at least for some time. All the widely used classification, regression and clustering algorithms that are available in WSO2 ML with a UI will make you think machine learning is easy! Yes, our web-based interface will let you easily navigate through the complete machine learning life cycle.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Get data</li>
                <li>Explore/analyse</li>
                <li>Build models</li>
                <li>Evaluate</li>
                <li>Predict/deploy</li>
            </ol>

            <p>No matter which of the above groups you belong to, you&rsquo;ll find it more convenient to do machine learning using WSO2 ML at no cost. The product will guide you through each step in an intuitive manner and let you review what you did with a comprehensive set of visualizations. Why visualizations? Because they speak a language we all understand and it&rsquo;s closer to us than numbers. These visualizations range from simple tables to sophisticated charts that help the data speak for itself.</p>

            <p>Your need can be either a low-level task such as training an ML model on a given dataset or a high-level task such as evaluating machine learning as an opportunity for your business. Either way, WSO2 ML will help you decide what to do and how to do it. No matter whether you are a newbie or an expert it will let you get your job done using the most powerful data processing tools available today.</p>

            <p>And when we say enterprise-ready, we mean seamless integration with other products offered by WSO2 from integration to API management. WSO2 ML can also be seen as a component of a complete analytics platform that includes batch, real-time and predictive analytics. We do not discriminate. If you are just starting here and looking for something to begin with, simply get the binary and you are good to go. If you are looking for an enterprise-level analytics solution with the power of machine learning, take a look at our platform and select the tools that will work for you. In both cases, it&rsquo;s free and it&rsquo;s the same product.</p>

            <p><b>What to expect?</b></p>

            <p>Machine learning as a field isn&rsquo;t going away anytime soon. Or I may say this is just the beginning. We are fully aware of its potential and the direction it is headed. In the initial release of WSO2 Machine Learner, we offer an essential but complete set of features for your machine learning tasks.</p>

            <p>Much like the field itself, our first release is just the beginning. We will be adding more and more features to WSO2 ML with cutting-edge tools and research. In upcoming releases, you can expect multilayer architecture support, extensive data pre-processing, recommender solutions, anomaly detection and PMML support. And that&rsquo;s not the end, we&rsquo;re thinking beyond. Keep tabs on us, we will let you know.</p>

            <p>Thanks for reading and happy machine learning!</p><br>
