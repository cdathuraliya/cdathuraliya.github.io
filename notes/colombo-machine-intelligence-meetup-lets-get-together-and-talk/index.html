            <p>I have been talking a lot about machine learning lately. It&rsquo;s no coincidence things happened that way, machine learning is what I get paid to do and it&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;m quite passionate about.</p>

            <p>As I wrote <a href="/notes/wso2-ml-machine-learning-for-everone/" target="_blank">somewhere else</a>, machine learning is taking over the world. Luckily it&rsquo;s not machines taking over. One thing might lead to another but we can discuss it later, hopefully we have some time. Machine intelligence (I prefer the term machine intelligence over artificial intelligence or machine learning simply because it sounds like a blend of both) is becoming a part of our lives day by day. It was inevitable and finally it is happening. From research to business, from fiction to news. But as a country, our readiness for this new wave of technology is questionable. Do we have a dedicated community or a place to meet and discuss this topic anywhere in Sri Lanka? We have a few closed spaces. But not an open space to talk about, share or learn.</p>

            <p>When I was an intern at my current workplace one year ago, it suddenly struck me; why don&rsquo;t we have a meetup for machine intelligence yet!? For those who are not familiar with <a href="http://www.meetup.com/" target="_blank">meetup.com</a>, this is how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meetup_(website)" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> describes it.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p><i>&ldquo;Meetup is an online social networking portal that facilitates offline group meetings in various localities around the world. Meetup allows members to find and join groups unified by a common interest, such as politics, books, games, movies, health, pets, careers or hobbies.&rdquo;</i></p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>This may not be the most innovative idea you have ever heard. But it works surprisingly well even without a free plan. We already have <a href="http://www.meetup.com/cities/lk/colombo/" target="_blank">over 50 meetups</a> in Sri Lanka on various topics. Naturally, most of them are related to technology. Tech folks catch up sooner than the others. Personally, I would like to see meetups on other non-tech topics as well. A year ago, we had meetups for almost every buzzword technology, from big data to cloud computing to IoT. Now we have meetups for lesser-known topics as well, such as <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Colombo-Gophers/" target="_blank">Go language</a> and <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Sri-Lanka-Bitcoin-Meetup/" target="_blank">Bitcoin</a>. Yet no sign of anything related to machine learning, artificial intelligence or data science. I shared this idea with a few other machine intelligence enthusiasts I personally knew back then. They showed a huge interest in both initiating and contributing. And I became a member of the <a href="/notes/wso2-ml-machine-learning-for-everone/" target="_blank">WSO2 Machine Learner</a> team. Still it took almost a year to materialize. Finally, we have a <a href="http://meetup.com/cmbmim" target="_blank">meetup on machine intelligence</a> and this is how we introduce it.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p><i>&ldquo;This meetup is for all researchers, industry experts, academics, students and enthusiasts who are passionate about this astounding field, Machine Intelligence. Want to learn more about machine intelligence theory and applications? Looking for your next research idea in AI? Looking for colleagues for your machine learning startup? Want to share your AI/ML knowledge and experience with wannabe experts? Trying to figure out the best tools and technologies for your analytics task? You think machine intelligence will be the next big thing? This is the place for you! Let&rsquo;s get together and talk!&rdquo;</i></p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>Within a few days, the group has attracted a few dozen members even before spreading the word around. It is fair to assume that what we are trying to do was missing in the picture. We hope to achieve several goals through this meetup.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Create a collaborative platform for machine intelligence industry and researchers.</li>
                <li>Encourage and support ongoing and new research in machine learning and artificial intelligence.</li>
                <li>Share knowledge and recent advancements in machine intelligence.</li>
                <li>Introducing opportunities and resources to the followers of this field.</li>
                <li>Create a platform to network with experts and enthusiasts.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This might sound somewhat serious, but we will be simply talking, sharing and learning. We already have individuals who are working in machine learning, artificial intelligence and data science at different levels. Most of the leading IT companies in Sri Lanka have started launching machine learning features in their products, others following with R&D. Academics and researchers have been working in the field of AI for a while. Students from both state and private universities are very interested in learning the basics and getting involved. But all these individuals and groups seem to be working in isolation. The missing piece here was the common platform to collaborate. A meetup fits into this gap perfectly, at least for now. It provides a space, most importantly offline, to meet and collaborate with peers who are involved and interested in the same field. We are planning to focus on all the aspects of machine intelligence including theoretical concepts, research, tools, applications and opportunities. We will be having our first meetup event very soon. And we will have no boundaries, only the genuine interest in learning and popularizing this next big wave of technology.</p>
