            <h1>Do we need history in the age of AI?</h1>

            <p><small>July 18, 2025</small></p>

            <p>There&rsquo;s been some talk about education reforms and updates to the school syllabus in Sri Lanka. Regardless of <a href="https://www.newswire.lk/2025/07/17/pm-responds-to-reports-on-history-subject/" target="_blank">how accurate that news is</a>, it has sparked a conversation about the importance of learning subjects like history. I&rsquo;m not an expert in education or history, but as someone who has worked in AI for a while, I have a few thoughts.</p>

            <p>Yes, that&rsquo;s correct. Well, I think so and let me explain.</p>

            <p>I think the biggest challenge of AI right now is making it an industry or an engineering field. All the other challenges were there for a while if you really think about it. There can be slowdowns and booms in fundamental research, talent can be in short supply, we still make progress. But I think we are yet to define AI as an industry. And we need to do it right away!</p>
