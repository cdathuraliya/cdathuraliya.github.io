            <h1>Do we need history in the age of AI?</h1>

            <p><small>July 18, 2025</small></p>

            <p>There&rsquo;s been some talk about education reforms and updates to the school syllabus in Sri Lanka. Regardless of <a href="https://www.newswire.lk/2025/07/17/pm-responds-to-reports-on-history-subject/" target="_blank">how accurate that news is</a>, it has sparked a conversation about the importance of learning subjects like history. I&rsquo;m not an expert in education or history, but as someone who has worked in AI for a while, I have a few thoughts.</p>

            <p>This is going to be a short one. While others <a href="https://thegradient.pub/openai-please-open-source-your-language-model/" target="_blank">argue over GPT-2</a>, we had to dig a little deeper into <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805" target="_blank">Google BERT</a>. If you are a follower of deep learning research, especially on the NLP side, BERT needs no introduction at this point. Since its initial release last October, dozens more resources have been added highlighting the significance of this work by Google. The <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/11/open-sourcing-bert-state-of-art-pre.html" target="_blank">official blog post</a> itself is a very good resource to understand the basics.</p>

            <h1>The biggest challenge of AI is not people or technology</h1>

            <p>Yes, that&rsquo;s correct. Well, I think so and let me explain.</p>

            <p>I think the biggest challenge of AI right now is making it an industry or an engineering field. All the other challenges were there for a while if you really think about it. There can be slowdowns and booms in fundamental research, talent can be in short supply, we still make progress. But I think we are yet to define AI as an industry. And we need to do it right away!</p>

            <h1>Sensing Space with Big Data</h1>

            <p><small>May 25, 2017</small></p>

            <p>The digital world is exploding with uncountable data. Millions of users generate information via thousands of sources every day. This data is then consumed for a number of purposes from business to entertainment.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p><i>Is there a purpose and potential for big data beyond business and entertainment?</i></p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>The big data team at LIRNEasia is trying to answer this question.</p>

            <h1>Showcasing Big Data and Machine Learning work at OpenAI SOCML 2016</h1>

            <p><small>October 26, 2016</small></p>

            <p>I was competitively selected to attend the Self-Organizing Conference on Machine Learning 2016 organized by OpenAI which was held in San Francisco on October 7-8, 2016.</p>

            <p>OpenAI is a non-profit artificial intelligence (AI) research company initiated by Elon Musk and top research scientists in AI and machine learning (ML) to promote safe and friendly AI. Since its inception in late 2015 the company has attracted top researchers and scientists from both industry and academia to work on the most interesting problems of AI. The Self-Organizing Conference on Machine Learning 2016 was an experimental gathering that OpenAI organized for the first time to promote collaboration amongst AI/ML researchers, overcoming the overheads of a conventional academic conference. This is how they presented the motive behind organizing this event.</p>

            <h1>WSO2 Machine Learner: Machine Learning for Everyone</h1>

            <p><small>September 17, 2015</small></p>

            <p>Machine learning is everywhere. If you do not agree, you just haven&rsquo;t noticed. It&rsquo;s in your smartphone, web browser, smartwatch if you use one, car very soon, and the list goes on making it simply everywhere. Machine learning has become one of the things that decides the future of mankind, one way or another. There was a time when artificial intelligence, the superset of machine learning, was something we read in science fiction. But not anymore.</p>
