        <h2>CD Athuraliya</h2>

        <p><em>engineer, researcher</em></p>

        <p>I'm a co-founder of the AI technology company, ConscientAI. I provide technical leadership and run most of the day-to-day operations. We have won awards, been <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/artificial-intelligence-climate-change" target="_blank">featured on National Geographic</a>, and published research. We are based in Colombo, Sri Lanka. Working with clients around the world.</p>

        <p>Before ConscientAI, I was a member of the <a href="https://github.com/wso2-attic/product-ml" target="_blank">WSO2 Machine Learner</a> team. Then I was a researcher at LIRNEasia's Big Data (now <a href="https://lirneasia.net/dap" target="_blank">Data, Algorithms and Policy</a>) team. I'm still a <a href="https://lirneasia.net/people/chathurike-cd-athuraliya/" target="_blank">Research Fellow</a> there.</p>

        <p>I founded and ran the first (to my knowledge) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170726151321/https://www.meetup.com/colombo-machine-intelligence/" target="_blank">machine learning meetup</a> in Sri Lanka with few other like-minded people. That led me (I think) to be <a href="https://lirneasia.net/2016/10/showcasing-big-data-and-machine-learning-work-at-openai-socml-2016/" target="_blank">selected</a> to attend the first SOCML, organized by Ian Goodfellow. This was held at OpenAI when it was a one-year-old startup people barely knew. Now the meetup is run by H2O.ai, I am no longer involved.</p>

        <p>I have co-authored <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3u_D9aoAAAAJ" target="_blank">a few publications</a>. I do talks/guest lectures on related topics and I supervise undergrad/postgrad projects as an external supervisor. I try to keep these up to date in my <a href="https://bit.ly/cv-cd-athuraliya" target="_blank">CV</a>.</p>

        <p>Not very active on social media. I tweet/retweet almost exclusively AI stuff on <a href="https://twitter.com/cdathuraliya" target="_blank">X</a> (Twitter), occasionally share insights on <a href="https://lk.linkedin.com/in/cdathuraliya" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
